Rimango.ImageField
======================
It is based on the ImageField from Sebastien from https://orchardimagefield.codeplex.com. 
I will add a new feature to allow the user to define the crop area by it's own.

Version 0.1
------------------
* Fork from https://orchardimagefield.codeplex.com
* Retarget to asp.net 4.5
* Working with Orchard 1.8.1 and up
