Rimango.ImageField
======================
It is based on the ImageField from Sebastien from https://orchardimagefield.codeplex.com. 
I will add a new feature to allow the user to define the crop area by it's own.

Version 0.2 (Pre-Alpha)
------------------
* UserCrop is implemented and seems to work, but needs still more testing and a bunch of code refactoring.
